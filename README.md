Flex cards is as flex cards do.
They do for me what they'll do for you.

If you have a flex container with rules like this:
  display: flex;
  justify-content: flex-start;
    (OR)
  justify-content: flex-end;
and you have the very specific need to keep all of the contained flex items a uniform width while ALSO having them be perfectly flush with both sides of the flex container, then this is just the thing for you.

It's great, in a very specific sort of way, for product pages and stuff so the don't look SLIGHTLY out of alignment thereby upsetting the delicate sensibilities of your visitors.
